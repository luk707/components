# Colors

The color theme extension provides the required colors for most components to work.

Here is an example color configuration:

```js
const theme = createTheme({
  config: {
    color: {
      primaryHue: 200,
      saturation: 0.9
    }
  }
})
```

The following options are available:

```js
{
  // Base color hues
  primaryHue = 263,
  secondaryHue = 107,

  // Contextual hue
  successHue = 0,
  warnHue = 0,
  infoHue = 0,
  dangerHue = 0,

  saturation = 0.14,
  lightness = 0.62,

  // How far do dark and light colors deviate
  // from the base saturation and lightness
  saturationDeviance = 0.04,
  lightnessDeviance = 0.05,

  // Hue and saturation for non perfect whites
  whiteHue = 23,
  whiteSaturation = 0.09,

  // Monochrome lightness
  whiteLightness = 0.99,
  offWhiteLightness = 0.96,
  greyLightness = 0.8,
  blackLightness = 0.14,
  shadowLightness = 0.14,

  // Define overrides for colors that aren't quite right
  overrides = {}
}
```
