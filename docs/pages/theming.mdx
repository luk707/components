# Theming

`@luk707/components` makes use of the `emotion-theming` library to allow you to customize the look of your application.

The theme can be configured by using the create theme function.

```js
import createTheme from '@luk707/components/lib/theme/create-theme'
```

Simply call it as a function and pass the returned object to your theme provider

```js
import React from 'react'
import { render } from 'react-dom'
import { ThemeProvider } from 'emotion-theming'
import createTheme from '@luk707/components/lib/theme/create-theme'
import App from './app'

const theme = createTheme()

render(
  <ThemeProvider theme={theme}>
    <App />
  </ThemeProvider>,
  document.getElementById("app")
)
```

*NOTE: this theme provider must wrap the whole application*

To change the theme of your application pass a config object to the createTheme function

```js
const theme = createTheme({
  config: {
    color: {
      primaryHue: 200,
      saturation: 0.9
    }
  }
})
```
